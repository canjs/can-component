@property {Object} can-component.prototype.events events
@parent can-component.prototype

Listen to events on elements and observables.

@option {Object.<can-control.eventDescription,can-control.eventHandler>} An object of event names and methods
that handle the event. For example:

```js
import Component from "can-component";

Component.extend( {
	ViewModel: {
		limit: "number",
		offset: "number",
		next: function() {
			this.offset = this.offset + this.limit;
		}
	},
	events: {
		".next click": function() {
			this.viewModel.next();
		},
		"{viewModel} limit": function( viewModel, ev, newValue ) {
			console.log( "limit is now", newValue );
		}
	}
} );
```

A component’s events object is used as the prototype of a [can-control]. The control gets created on the component’s
element.

The component’s [can-component.prototype.ViewModel] instance is available within event handlers as `this.viewModel`.

The component element is available as `this.element`.

## Use

[can-component]’s events object allows you to provide low-level [can-control]-like abilities to a `Component`
while still accessing the `Component`’s [can-component::ViewModel].  The following
example listens to clicks on elements with `className="next"` and calls `.next()` on the component’s viewModel.

@codepen

The events object can also listen to objects or properties on the component’s [can-component::ViewModel] instance. For instance, instead
of using live-binding, we could listen to when offset changes and update the page manually:

### Special events: inserted and removed

In previous versions of CanJS, components had the ability to bind to special
`inserted` and `removed` events that were called when a component’s element had
been inserted into or removed from the page:

```js
{
	events: {
		"inserted": function() {

			// called when the component’s tag is inserted into the DOM
		},
		"removed": function() {

			// called when the component’s tag is removed from the DOM
		}
	}
}
```

You can still bind to these special events by using the
[can-3-4-compat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/can-3-4-compat) package, but this
is deprecated in favor of the new [can-component/connectedCallback] API. See
more information about migrating away from the inserted and removed events in
the [migrate-4] guide.

## High performance view rendering

While [can-stache-bindings] conveniently allows you to call a [can-component::ViewModel] method from a view like:

```html
<input on:change="doSomething()"/>
```

This has the effect of binding an event handler directly to this element. Every element that has a `on:click` or similar attribute has an event handler bound to it. For a large grid or list, this could have a performance penalty.

By contrast, events bound using [can-component]’s events object use event delegation, which is useful for high performance view rendering. In a large grid or list, event delegation only binds a single event handler rather than one per row.
